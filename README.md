# A-gentle-approach-to-object-localization
A machine learning pipeline was created to perform object localization using Keras and Tensorflow.
We process our dataset stored in a TFRecord format.
The VGG16 architecture is used as a regression model to predict the bounding boxes coordinates.
After training we pick a random set of test images, visualize our predictions and evaluate with the Intersection Over Union
